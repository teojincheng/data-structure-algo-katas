# data structures and algorithms katas

For people who have nothing better to do

This is not course material and has nothing related to the course.

### Suggested path for data structures

1. fixedLengthArray
1. queue
1. stack
1. fixedLengthQueue
1. circularQueue
1. linkedList

### Suggested path for algorithms

1. binary search

## Setup

```
  npm install
```

## Run

Run tests for a specific data structure (Example uses queue):

```
   npx jest --testNamePattern="Queue"
```

If name pattern crashes, you can use the exact file path

```
 npx jest dataStructure/queue/queue.test.js
```

Run a .js file (Example uses array-playground.js)

```
  node dataStructure/array/array-playground.js
```
